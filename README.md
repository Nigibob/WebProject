# WebProject

## Introduction

The project in itself is a simple web API with a dashboard that should allow you to :

* API side 
  - CRUD users 
  - Authenticate
  - CRUD your own metrics (make use of an authorization middleware)
* Front side
  - Home page
  - Sign In / Sign Up / Sign Out
  - Insert/update/delete metrics once logged in
  - Retrieve the user’s metrics and display it in a graph
  - Only access the user’s metrics, not the other ones
* Utils 
  - pre-populate the database with at least two users and their own metrics


## Start

At first you have to execute 
`npm install`

Then 
`npm start`

You now go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Observations
A lot of the requirements are still missing due to lack of time
